                <p>
                    Hi there, I'm Tariq
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Graduated from Kingston University in Mathematics </li>
                    <li>I'm currently working as a Software Engineer Consultant at Xander Talent</li>
                    <li>Fun Facts: I'm a mulit-instrumentalist and can solve a rubics cube in under 25sec</li>
                    <li>I have a strong passion for learning and developing new skills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing University, I decided that I wanted to enter the Software industry.
                    In my spare time, I self studied to gain the technical skills needed to apply for roles.
                    I am now working at Xander Talent as a Software Engineer Consultant gaining more knowledge
                    and experiance in Software.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I now have a strong understanding and experiance in a variety of programming languages,
                    including Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java and C#. I have also worked with web development
                    frameworks such as Django and React.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I practice challenging myself in everything I do, always aiming for the best results. I see
                    improvement as a must in whatever problem or solution I come across. Always seeking growth and development.
                </p>
